## Gulp Susy Breakpoint Globbing Starter 

  
### First you need to setup node on your "server"
```
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.31.0/install.sh | bash
```

### Look Here for how to set up Node Version Manager
https://github.com/creationix/nvm

Specifically
In place of a version pointer like "0.10" or "5.0" or "4.2.1", you can use the following special default aliases with nvm install, nvm use, nvm run, nvm exec, nvm which, etc:

```
node: this installs the latest version of node
iojs: this installs the latest version of io.js
stable: this alias is deprecated, and only truly applies to node v0.12 and earlier. Currently, this is an alias for node.
unstable: this alias points to node v0.11 - the last "unstable" node release, since post-1.0, all node versions are stable. (in semver, versions communicate breakage, not stability).
```
